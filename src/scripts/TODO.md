# Make everything more modular, and make better use of imports.

-   Modular packaging: each script packaged with its css.
-   Some of the current scripts should be split into several; others should be combined

# Dropdown layout

-   Improve layout of dropdown report. 
-   Add information about other parts of the unit: reading, mastery check, status.
-   Flexbox layout instead of list?
-   Rethink the list of exercises: students use it to avoid reading. 

# Pagination

-   Enforced or optional pagination layout: each subsection is its own page; each exercise is its own page. Wrap sections in <section> tags?
-   Enforced exercise completion to view later sections? Perhaps with optional pop-outs for more help/explanation.
-   Exercise focus mode
-   Allow popouts (e.g., rule lists) to genuinely pop out and get dragged around.

# Accessibility

-   Font selection widget: open-dyslexic; arial?
-   Logic symbols for dyslexia?

# Top Menu Bar

-   Rewrite with modular widgets: toc widget; font widget; theme widget; links widget. 
-   Move the Gradebook and GroupMe links into the user dropdown menu.
-   Always visible unit label, title, assignment type.
-   Consider overlaying the title of the unit on top of the progress bar.

# Communication

-   Chatbot instead of groupme. Matrix? Needs to allow for screenshots. 
-   Button to take screenshot of current exercise (see html2canvas.js) to encourage screenshots instead of photos of screen.
-   making copying/screenshots harder on mastery checks, to discourage students from saving screenshots of those problems https://myprogrammingnotes.com/?p=864
-   link that directly creates a groupme chat using the groupme API, and autopopulates the message.

# Gradebook/Table of Contents

-   Integrate these into one thing (students are confused and using both)
-   Color-coded to allow students to easily see what they have completed, where they are behind.


A progress chart that shows students how their progress is going.
